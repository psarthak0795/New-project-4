# Org Activity Tracker (Hubstaff-style)

A working employee time & activity tracker: a desktop agent that runs on
each employee's machine, a backend API, and an admin web dashboard.

**Important — one backend, many agents.** For an organization rollout there
is exactly **one** backend (running on a central server) and **one**
dashboard, but the desktop agent runs on **every** employee's machine and
they all point at that same central backend. Don't run a separate backend
per employee — see "Deploying across your organization" below.

## Why this stack

- **Backend: Python + FastAPI** — async REST endpoints, automatic OpenAPI
  docs at `/docs`, and Pydantic validation with very little boilerplate.
  SQLAlchemy + SQLite locally, swap to Postgres in production by changing
  one env var (needed once several employees are writing at once — see
  below).
- **Desktop agent: Python** — has to run natively on Windows, macOS, *and*
  Ubuntu. `mss` does cross-platform screenshotting, `pystray` gives a native
  system tray icon with a Start/Stop menu on all three OSes, and it packages
  into a single .exe with PyInstaller so employees never need Python
  installed.
- **Frontend: React (Vite)** — a small admin SPA that talks to the same
  backend API.

## Project layout

```
backend/          FastAPI server, SQLAlchemy models, JWT auth
desktop-agent/     The tracker that runs on employee machines
frontend/          React admin dashboard (users, timesheets, screenshots)
```

## How the tracking flow works

1. An **admin** logs into the dashboard and creates employee accounts
   (`POST /users`).
2. An **employee** runs the desktop agent and logs in once via a small
   login window — a token is cached locally so this only happens once
   (until the token expires or is cleared).
3. Employee clicks **Start Tracking** in the tray icon:
   - Agent calls `POST /time-entries/start` with its public IP → backend
     opens a `TimeEntry` row (start time, IP, user).
   - A background thread starts a loop.
4. Every 5 minutes (configurable via `SCREENSHOT_INTERVAL_SECONDS`), the
   agent captures the screen, gets the current public IP, and uploads both
   to `POST /screenshots` along with the active time entry ID.
5. Backend saves the image under `backend/storage/screenshots/<user_id>/...`
   and a row in the `screenshots` table (user, time entry, file path, IP,
   timestamp).
6. Employee clicks **Stop Tracking** → `POST /time-entries/{id}/stop` closes
   the entry and records total duration.
7. Admin dashboard reads `/time-entries` and `/screenshots` to show who's
   currently tracking, timesheets, and a screenshot gallery per session.
8. If the agent restarts (PC reboot, crash) while a session was active, it
   re-syncs with the backend on startup (`GET /time-entries/active`) instead
   of losing track of the running session.

## Running it locally (one machine, for development/testing)

Quickest way: after doing the one-time setup below for each of the three
folders, just double-click **`start-all.bat`** at the project root — it
opens three windows (Backend / Frontend / Desktop Agent) at once. The
sections below are that one-time setup, and what each window is actually
running.

**Backend**
```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
python create_admin.py        # create the first admin login
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

**Desktop agent** (for development — running from source with Python
installed; see "Deploying" below for the packaged .exe employees actually
use)
```bash
cd desktop-agent
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env          # set BACKEND_URL
python agent.py
```
A small login window opens on first run (or when the saved token is
invalid/expired); after that it's cached and you go straight to the tray
icon.

**Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```
Dashboard: http://localhost:5173 — log in with the admin account you created.

This was smoke-tested end-to-end in this environment: admin creation, login,
start-tracking, screenshot upload, stop-tracking, and listing all worked
against the real FastAPI app. The desktop agent's screenshot capture, and
the login window's actual on-screen appearance, need a real display
(Windows/macOS/Ubuntu desktop session) to fully verify — they can't be
exercised headlessly here, though the same widget-construction code was
verified to run correctly against a live display during development.

### Windows convenience scripts (this folder)

- **`run.bat`** — the one file to double-click. On a brand-new computer (or
  if the venvs are missing/broken — e.g. this folder was copied from
  another machine), it automatically runs setup first, then starts
  everything silently in the background. On every run after that, it just
  starts everything in a few seconds — no thinking required either way.
- **`setup.bat`** — what `run.bat` calls automatically when needed. Creates
  fresh `venv` folders for the backend and desktop agent and installs all
  dependencies, using whichever Python/Node.js are already installed on
  that machine. You can also run it directly if you want to force a clean
  rebuild.
- **`start-all.bat`** — opens backend/frontend/agent each in their own
  visible console window instead of silently — useful for development, so
  you can see the logs.
- **`start-all-background.vbs`** (launched via `start-all-background.bat`,
  which is what `run.bat` uses) — starts the same three things silently,
  with no visible windows.
- **`install-local-autostart.bat`** / **`uninstall-local-autostart.bat`** —
  adds/removes a Startup-folder shortcut so the whole stack (backend,
  dashboard, and agent) launches automatically when this Windows user logs
  in, with no manual step at all — not even double-clicking `run.bat`.
- **`stop-all.bat`** — stops any backend/frontend/agent processes that were
  started from this project folder.

### Moving this project to a different computer

**Do not copy the `venv` folders (`backend\venv`, `desktop-agent\venv`) or
`frontend\node_modules` to another computer** — e.g. don't include them in
a zip you upload/transfer. A Python virtual environment hardcodes the exact
file path of the Python installation that created it; on a different
computer (or even the same computer with Python reinstalled elsewhere),
that path won't exist and every script that uses it will fail with an
error like:

```
Python Launcher is sorry to say ...
No Python at 'C:\Users\<name>\AppData\Local\Python\pythoncore-3.12-64\pythonw.exe'
```

To move this project correctly:
1. Copy everything **except** `backend\venv`, `desktop-agent\venv`, and
   `frontend\node_modules` (in File Explorer, select all files/folders
   except those three before zipping/copying — this also keeps the
   transfer far smaller than including them).
2. On the destination computer, double-click **`run.bat`**. It notices the
   venvs are missing, runs setup automatically, then starts everything —
   no separate steps needed. (If you'd rather do it manually, run
   `setup.bat` yourself first, then `start-all.bat`.)

### The backend port — one setting, never hardcoded per machine

`backend\.env`'s `PORT` value is the **only** place the backend's port is
ever set. `desktop-agent\.env` and `frontend\.env` don't have their own
independent port setting — every time `setup.bat` runs (including
automatically, via `run.bat`), it reads `PORT` from `backend\.env` and
rewrites the `localhost:<port>` portion of `BACKEND_URL` /
`VITE_BACKEND_URL` in those two files to match, on whatever computer it's
running on. `start-all-background.vbs` and `start-backend.bat` also read
`PORT` from `backend\.env` directly instead of hardcoding a number.

This means: if port 8000 is already taken by something else on a
particular machine, change `PORT` in that machine's `backend\.env` and
re-run `setup.bat` (or just `run.bat`) — every other component
automatically follows, on that machine only. It also means you should
never edit a port number directly inside `start-backend.bat` or
`start-all-background.vbs` — change it in `backend\.env` instead, or the
next `setup.bat` run will overwrite your edit back to whatever
`backend\.env` says.

(This is the fix for a real bug hit during development: two launcher
scripts once had a hardcoded port that didn't match the `.env.example`
templates, so a fresh clone on a different computer had the agent silently
unable to reach the backend — the login window would appear, but nothing
would happen after entering credentials, with no visible error since the
agent runs without a console window. That specific failure mode is why the
port is now centralized instead of repeated in multiple files.)

## Deploying across your organization

This is the part that turns the local demo above into something installed
on every employee's PC. Three phases:

### 1. Stand up the central backend (once)

Pick one machine or server that will run the backend permanently and that
every employee's PC can reach over the network (your office LAN, a VPN, or
a small cloud VM if people work remotely).

- Follow the backend setup above on that machine, but:
  - Switch `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` to Postgres, not SQLite — SQLite can hit
    "database is locked" errors once multiple employees' screenshots are
    landing at overlapping times. Install Postgres, then:
    `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/tracker`
    (uncomment `psycopg2-binary` in `requirements.txt` first).
  - Set a real, random `JWT_SECRET_KEY` — never ship the example value.
  - Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `.env` to your dashboard's real URL instead of
    `*`, e.g. `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://tracker.yourcompany.com`.
  - Run uvicorn bound to all interfaces so other machines can reach it:
    `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` (drop `--reload` in
    production — it's a dev convenience).
  - Open port 8000 (or whichever you choose) in that machine's firewall.
  - Strongly recommended: put this behind a reverse proxy (nginx/Caddy) with
    a real HTTPS certificate, so credentials and screenshots aren't sent in
    plaintext across your network. This isn't set up for you here — it
    depends on your domain/hosting choice.

### 2. Build and distribute the desktop agent

On a Windows dev machine, with the venv active:
```bash
cd desktop-agent
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-build.txt
build-agent.bat
```
This produces `dist\OrgTrackerAgent.exe` — a single file, no Python
required on employee machines.

For each employee's PC:
1. Copy `OrgTrackerAgent.exe` into a permanent folder (e.g.
   `C:\Program Files\OrgTracker\`).
2. Copy a `.env` file into that **same folder**, containing your real
   central backend's address:
   ```
   BACKEND_URL=https://tracker.yourcompany.com
   SCREENSHOT_INTERVAL_SECONDS=300
   ```
   (This is the one thing that has to be correct per-deployment — copy the
   same `.env` to every machine since they all point at the same backend.)
3. Run `install-autostart.bat` from that same folder once — this adds a
   launcher to that Windows user's Startup folder so the agent starts
   automatically every time they log in, with no manual step after that.
   (`uninstall-autostart.bat` reverses it.)
4. On first launch, the employee sees a small login window and logs in with
   the account an admin created for them. After that, the login is cached
   (in `%APPDATA%\OrgTracker\auth_token.json`) and won't ask again until it
   expires.

macOS/Ubuntu: PyInstaller can build for those OSes too (run `build-agent.bat`'s
`pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --name OrgTrackerAgent agent.py` command
on a Mac/Linux machine instead of Windows — PyInstaller isn't cross-compiling,
you build on the OS you're targeting). Auto-start on those platforms uses a
different mechanism (a `launchd` LaunchAgent on macOS, a `.desktop` autostart
entry or systemd `--user` service on Ubuntu) — not scripted here yet, but
the agent itself already runs on both without changes.

### 3. Build and host the dashboard

Running `npm run dev` forever isn't meant for production. Build it once and
serve the static output:
```bash
cd frontend
# point this at your real central backend before building:
echo "VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://tracker.yourcompany.com" > .env
npm run build      # outputs frontend/dist/
```
Serve `frontend/dist/` with any static file host — nginx, Caddy, or even
a simple `npx serve dist`. Give managers/admins that URL to log in from any
browser.

### Rollout checklist

- [ ] Central backend running on a reachable server, with Postgres, a real
      `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, and `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` restricted to the dashboard URL.
- [ ] HTTPS in front of the backend (reverse proxy) — not done for you here.
- [ ] `OrgTrackerAgent.exe` built and distributed with a `.env` pointing at
      the real backend URL (not `localhost`).
- [ ] `install-autostart.bat` run on each employee machine.
- [ ] Dashboard built (`npm run build`) and hosted somewhere reachable by
      managers, pointed at the real backend URL.
- [ ] Employee accounts created (admin, via `/docs` for now — see gaps below).
- [ ] Employees notified/consented per "Legal/compliance" below — do this
      **before** distributing the agent, not after.

## Important: legal/compliance before you deploy this

Screen capture + IP logging of employees is regulated in most
jurisdictions. Before rolling this out to real staff:

- **Disclose it.** Tell employees monitoring is happening, what's captured,
  and how it's used — ideally have them sign an acknowledgment. Silent
  monitoring is illegal in a number of countries/states (e.g. several US
  states require notice; India's IT Act and various EU/GDPR rules impose
  similar obligations if you have staff there).
- **Limit scope.** Only capture during active work sessions the employee
  started themselves (which is what this design does — nothing happens
  until they click Start).
- **Secure the data.** Screenshots can contain passwords, personal chats,
  banking info, etc. Encrypt at rest, restrict who in the dashboard can view
  them, and set a retention/deletion policy.
- **Check local counsel** if you operate in multiple countries — monitoring
  law varies a lot by state/country.

## What's intentionally left out (natural next steps)

- Idle-time detection (pause capture after N minutes of no input).
- Blurring/redacting sensitive screen regions before upload.
- A signed installer (current packaging is a plain .exe — Windows
  SmartScreen may warn on first run since it's unsigned; code-signing
  removes that warning but requires a certificate).
- macOS/Ubuntu auto-start scripts (the agent runs on both; the auto-start
  wiring above is Windows-only so far).
- Retry/queueing for screenshot uploads that fail (e.g. backend briefly
  unreachable) — currently that interval's screenshot is just lost.
- A proper "Add Employee" page in the dashboard (currently via `/docs`).
- Projects/tasks assignment, weekly reports, activity-level (mouse/keyboard)
  scoring — the `activity_level` column already exists on `Screenshot` for
  this.
- Password reset / employee self-registration flows.
