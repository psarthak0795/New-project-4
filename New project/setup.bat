@echo off
REM Run this ONCE on every new computer, right after copying the project
REM here (see note below about what NOT to copy). It builds fresh virtual
REM environments and installs dependencies using whatever Python/Node.js
REM are already installed on THIS machine - it does not install Python or
REM Node itself, and does not download anything except the pip/npm
REM packages this project needs.
REM
REM IMPORTANT - why this script exists:
REM Python virtual environments (the "venv" folders) are NOT portable.
REM They hardcode the exact path of the Python install that created them.
REM If you zip this whole project (including backend\venv and
REM desktop-agent\venv) and copy it to a different computer, those venvs
REM will be broken there, even though the files are all present - that's
REM the "No Python at ..." error. The fix is to delete/exclude the venv
REM folders before moving the project, and run this script fresh on the
REM new machine instead. This script is safe to re-run any time - it only
REM rebuilds the venv/node_modules folders, never touches your .env files,
REM database, or captured screenshots.

REM Pass --auto (used by run.bat) to skip "press any key" prompts so setup
